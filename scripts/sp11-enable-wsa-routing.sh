# Enable WSA speaker routing on the Surface Pro 11 after the AudioReach DSP
# graph has loaded. This runs as a systemd service after the sound card
# appears, avoiding the boot race where alsactl restores WSA mixer state
# before the DSP finishes loading the audio graph.
#
# The APM CMD timeout (APM_CMD_GRAPH_OPEN) is a kernel-level race between
# ADSP firmware boot and the topology loader. It happens on every boot but
# the DSP sometimes recovers and sometimes doesn't. This script:
#   1. Waits for the SoundWire slaves to reach Attached state
#   2. If they don't (graph failed), unbinds and rebinds the sound card
#      with a delay to give the DSP more time
#   3. Retries up to 3 times
#   4. Once the graph is loaded, enables WSA routing
#
# See docs/adr/adr-0035-audio-boot-race-alsactl.md for the full diagnosis.
